# DATA CHECKING
```R
# loading libraries
library(relaimpo)
library(ggplot2) # Data visualization
library(ggthemes) # Plot themes
library(plotly) # Interactive data visualizations
library(dplyr) # Data manipulation
library(psych) # Will be used for correlation visualization
library(corrplot) # Correlation visualizations
library(corrr) # Correlation visualizations

```

```R
# impoorting our data
# reading our data
df <- fread('http://bit.ly/IPAdvertisingData')

```

```R
# previewing the dataset
View(df)

```

```R
# previewing the column names
colnames(df)

```

```R
# previewing the dataset
class(df)

```

```R
# previewing the head of the dataset
head(df, n = 5)

```

```R
# previewing the tail of the dataset
tail(df, n = 5)

```

```R
# checking the structure of the data
str(df)

```

```R
# checking the dimension/shape of the data
dim(df)

```

# DATA CLEANING
## Missing Values
```R
# checking for missing values
sum(is.na(df))

```

```R
# displaying all rows from the dataset which don't contain any missing values 
na.omit(df)

```
## Duplicates
```R
# checking for duplicates
duplicated_rows <- df[duplicated(df),]
```

```R
# dealing with duplicates
sum(is.na(df))

```

```R
# Removing these duplicated rows in the dataset or 
# showing these unique items and assigning to a variable unique_items below
# ---
#
unique_items <- df[!duplicated(df), ]

# What about seeing what these unique items are?
# ---
#
unique_items
```

## Anomalies
```R
# checking for anomalies

```

## Checking for outliers

```R
# visualising any existing outliers using a boxplot
boxplot(df)

```

```R
# listing the outliers in the vectors
boxplot.stats(df)$out

```


# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
## Univariate Analysis
### Measures of Central Tendency
```R
# Finding the mean
df.dist.mean <- mean(df$dist)

```

```R
# Finding the mode
getmode <- function(v) {
   uniqv <- unique(v)
   uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]
}

df.dist.mode <- getmode(df$dist)

```

```R
# Finding the median
df.dist.median <- median(df$dist)

```
### Measures of Dispersion

```R
# Finding the minimum code
df.dist.min <- min(df$dist)

```

```R
# Finding the maximum code
athletes.dist.max <- max(hills$dist)

```

```R
# finding the range code
athletes.dist.range <- range(hills$dist)

```

```R
# finding the quantile code
athletes.dist.quantile <- quantile(hills$dist)

```

```R
# finding the variance code
athletes.dist.variance <- var(hills$dist)

```

```R
# finding the standard deviation code
athletes.dist.sd <- sd(hills$dist)

```

### Univariate Graphical

```R
# creating a boxplot graph
boxplot(hills$dist)

```

```R
# fetching the columns
school <- painters$School

# fetching the frequency distribution
school_frequency <- table(school)

# plotting the bargraph
barplot(school_frequency)

```

```R
# creating a histogram
hist(faithful$eruptions)

```


## Bivariate analysis
```R
# assigning columns to variables
waiting<- faithful$waiting

# finding the covariance
cov(eruptions, waiting)

```

```R
# finding the correlation
cor(eruptions, waiting)

```

### Graphical Techniques

```R
# creating a scatterplot
plot(eruptions, waiting, xlab="Eruption duration", ylab="Time waited")

```
